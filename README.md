# 21-Jump-Tree
21 Jump Tree is a 2D platformer game similar to the Super Mario and Doodle Jump games, with an addition of an arcing projectile shooting mechanism. The player is a farmer with a bazooka that can shoot flower petals and fruit toward an enemy target. The object is to move the player either vertically and/or horizontally until the finish line safely. To shoot the flower or fruit, the player must collect their seed ammo. Enemies will walk and fly around the levels. The player collects ammo seeds and shoots with a bazooka in an arc (projectile motion) to the Enemy. After finding a key and bringing it to a portal, the main character can move on to the next stage (next level, total 3 levels).
